<h3 className='text-2xl font-medium'>What is meet.js?</h3>

A community of JavaScript and Web Technology meetup organizers spanning many cities in Poland that’s non-commercial and free and resilient.

On a <b>Valentines Day eve</b> in 2011 a group of JavaScript and Web Technology enthusiasts gathered for the first time in a pub in Poznań under the meet.js logo (and some heart shaped decorations already prepped for the day after).<br/><br/>
Our community has spread to many cities across Poland and has organized countless meetings and a good deal of conferences since.
meet.js is non-commercial and doesn’t even have a foundation behind it. What powers its success and gives it resilience is the joyful enthusiasm of local organizers showing up to put in the work necessary to get their peers in a room for some learning and networking.
Our approach to organizing at minimal cost and complexity with focus on tech enthusiasts and dedicated individuals creates resilience that makes meet.js the oldest Web Technology meetup that’s still alive and kicking!

The semi-yearly conference we organize is called [meet.js Summit](https://summit.meetjs.pl) and we went further than non-commercial with that - we’re partnering with charity organizations
